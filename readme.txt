Allow your bbPress users to bookmark other users easily and view/search them through their bbP profiles.

== Description ==

bbPress Contacts allows you to add contact and bookmarking customizable buttons (add contact/remove contact) to bbPress profiles, and in the forums below topics and replies author details.

These buttons will permit logged in members to add this user as contact or remove them as contact.

A contacts section is added to the bbPress profile of current user, allowing them to:

- View bookmarked users and contacts
- Search these users
- Quick removing a contact with a small cross button
- Paginating through these results.

Also, AJAX can be enabled (enabled by default) to process buttons faster, and process the search, pagination and list the available contacts in the bbPress profile page.

You can set it up the way you want, bbPress Contacts is translation-ready and easy to customize, so you can possibly rename "Add Contact" to "Bookmark" or "Add as Friend", etc.

I will write a blog post about using and customizing this plugin. Be sure to check https://blog.samelh.com
